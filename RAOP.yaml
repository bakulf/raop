  title: "RAOP: Rethorical Annotation Ontology Project"
  subtitle: "Editor's Draft 5 March 2015"
  abstract: "This project aims to build a domain-specific ontology for the annotation of figures of speech, called RAOP – Rhetorical Annotation Ontology Project. RAOP will allow users to map rhetorical aspects of written and oral texts. Informed by the study of classical and modern rhetorical scholarship, this ontology, based on W3C Linked data and Semantic Web, will be a powerful model to represent the complexity of hierarchical and non-hierarchical structures such as a rhetorical system. Built in RDF, RAOP could also be expanded to all standards of Semantic Web and it could be used together with other formal ontologies already in existence such as FRBR, TEI and, CIDOC-CRM. This project is one of the possible approaches taken into consideration to digitize figures of speech by using technologies associated with Linked data and Semantic Web."

  - name: Introduction
    content: "The aim of this project is to provide a tool for the digitization of figures of speech by using technologies associated with Linked data and the Semantic Web. Rhetoric as the art of discourse encompass a variety of principles and strategies – figures of speech and other compositional techniques – for the construction of a persuasive speaking or writing. Since the Aristotle to the early 20th century, this discipline was mainly dedicated to train students to be eloquent in a public space. The proliferation of schools produced many tutorials, several definitions and theories that allow a variety of methods and specialism. The purpose of RAOP is to support the rhetorical and syntactical digital literary analysis together with a scholarly theoretical approach of this realm.\n\n
              Rhetoric is a set of operations made on language necessarily dependent on certain characteristics of language: all rhetorical operations are fundamental property of linear discourse which means that a discourse can be decomposed into a smaller and smaller units. RAOP seek to create the way for the representation of complex text structures as a rhetorical figure that involves multiple co-existing, hierarchical and no-hierarchical structure of annotation.\n\n
              A figure of speech could belong to different categories characterized and distinguished by a combination of words with similar sounds or meanings, and it has a wide range of properties that involves the structure of the phrase. Rhetoric as the art of discourse encompasses a variety of principles and strategies – figures of speech and other compositional techniques – for the construction of a persuasive speaking or writing. Since the Aristotle to the early 20th century this discipline was mainly dedicated to train students: the proliferation of schools produced many tutorials, several definitions and theories, allowing differing purposes and methods.\n\n
              A project such as ours aims to build a system to enable the user to detect figures of speech in order to disentangle mechanisms – grammatical and stylistic rules -  that construct a discourse or the aspects of rhetoric that make communication more persuasive.In this project, we decided to take into account the categorisation found in the _Manuale di retorica_ - Garavelli's most recent Italian masterpiece."

  - name: Concept
    content: "Following Garavelli's work, the RAOP hierarchy is organised into three main branches or categories: figures of speech, figures of thought, and tropes.\n\n
               1. _Figures of speech_ which employ repetition – _repetition_ of words or sounds in a specific pattern - are often used to gain attention, create an emphasis or, amplify a meaning. A figure of speech will include as _subclasses_ rhetorical devices belonging to this category such as, for instance, an _anaphora_. An _anaphora_ consists of repeating a sequence (_group_) of _words_ at the beginnings of sentences that are close to each other.

               2. _Figures of thought_ are a method of presenting ideas, feelings and concepts in an artful way. These figures of thought do not add new meaning and provide a new shade able to influence the first meaning. For instance, a _chiasmus_, which consists of four items – words or clauses – related to each other through a reversal of structures. These rhetorical devices could be linked to another resource called a _syntactical figure_. 

               3. Each of these rhetorical devices have properties or _functions_. The four categories of change – which are called _quadripartita ratio_ (Quint. _Inst._ 1.5.38) - are functions or operations governing that provide a standard means of the formation of all figures of speech are perceived as an alteration.

               * addition (per _adiectionem_), by adding to the item one or more components;

               * omission (per _detractionem_), by removing one or more components from a given item;

               * transposition (per _transmutationem_), by changing the position of a component within the item. Also called transferring;

               * permutation (per _immutationem_), by replacing one or more components of the whole iotem from outside. Immutatio is also called anthisesis.

               4. _Tropes_ are a deviation from the ordinary meaning of words in their literal principal form. We are currently working on three _subclasses_ in particular: metaphor, metonymy and synecdoche. In order to support the explanation and justify the strong interpretative act needed for these rhetorical figures, the encoding includes an explanation of the meaning.\n\n
	       This project holds that the annotation of rhetorical figures is important not only for linguistic purposes, but also for discovering different styles of writing, purpose, and styles/typologies of written documents and genres. The study of rhetoric allows us to comprehensively analyse how language is used, looking at its emotional impact as much as its propositional content."
